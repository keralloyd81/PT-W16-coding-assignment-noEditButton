# Assignment Instructions
## Description
For this project we're going to build a CRUD app using React. In this project, we won’t connect to an API. We’ll get there soon! You’ll work on this project over the course of three weeks.

Important Note:  For the assignment you MUST include your GitHub URL and Video URL in the response when submitting the assignment.

## Week 16
This week you’ll add a form (or forms, if you’d like) to your app. A create form and/or an update form.

## Task 1: Make a form
At this point, users should be able to create new items, but those items always have the same data. And they should be able to update items, but only in a very simple way.

Now we want to build a form for the app that allows the user to either create or update items with specific data.

The form can be in a modal or collapsible sidebar, or it can just be always visible in the app.

Warning: Making an update form that’s always visible can get a little tricky, because you have to update the in-progress form state to match the data of the item you’re editing when you pick an item to edit. If you’d like to try it, you may need to do some research into how to handle it correctly. Making an update form in a modal usually works much nicer, because the insides of the modal get torn down and recreated every time the modal is opened.

## Task 2: Test
Make sure your app is working correctly by testing out the form in various ways. Make sure you can use the form multiple times to create or update different items.

At this point, your project must meet this new requirement:

It has either a create form or an update form with at least 2 inputs

As well as the requirements from previous weeks:

It has at least 3 React components

It’s displaying the data

It’s using at least 1 prop

A user can create new items

A user can delete items

A user can update at least one property on the items


The app does NOT need to connect to an API. So when the page is refreshed, all the changes will be lost. That’s not a problem, we’ll learn how to save to a backend soon.
